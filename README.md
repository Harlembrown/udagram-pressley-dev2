This is my 2nd Udacity Code Developer Nanodegree Project

CRITERIA I have met the required SPECIFICATIONS per the rubrics as
follows:

The project demonstrates an understanding of a good cloud git process.
Created an Elastic Beanstalk endpoint. My EB endpoint is visible in the AWS
Management console and deployment screenshot and opens in a web browser.                             
I have submitted screenshots showing eb cli & eb init as well as npm run dev. 
Re-built eb env to get the Archive.zip file and have the .elasticbeanstalk folder with
the config.yml                                                       
Here is my endpoint:
